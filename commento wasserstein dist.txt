"""
    Compute the 1-Wasserstein distance between two discrete distributions using Gurobi.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    mu : array-like, shape (m,)
        Probability distribution of the first set of points (source).
    nu : array-like, shape (n,)
        Probability distribution of the second set of points (target).
    cost_matrix : array-like, shape (m, n)
        The cost matrix where cost_matrix[i][j] is the cost of transporting mass from
        point i in mu to point j in nu.
    
    Returns:
    --------
    wasserstein_distance : float
        The computed Wasserstein distance between mu and nu.
    transport_plan : array, shape (m, n)
        The optimal transport plan.
